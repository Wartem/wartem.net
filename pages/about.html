            <p>
              Developing systems and finding solutions to problems is what I'm
              passionate about.

                Programming is a tool to achieve my goals. Being proficient in various development environments allows me 
                to quickly implement my ideas. On this page, I want to share some of the work I've done, and possibly what 
                I'm currently working on.

                The current focus is to excel in Python and achieve the highest level of proficiency, particularly in Flask for web 
                development, 
                Pandas and Matplotlib for data analysis and visualization, web scraping techniques, and utilizing the OpenAI API for 
                advanced applications.

                Its main feature is removing disturbing elements such as violence, 
                thereby making the game safe for children. New fun features are also added. 
                It's a huge project that I worked on, on and off, for 6-7 years in my spare time. 
                It's one of my bigger projects and has over 20,000 lines of code. 
                The focus here was on problem-solving within the context of ScriptHook V SDK.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                A lot of problem-solving was required to make this modification
                possible since there's no official SDK from the creators of the
                game, and the working of many native functions had to be guessed
                through trial and error. I've been active in the research led by
                Alexander Blade and published my findings in his native function
                database.

              <ol>
                <li>
                  Since the game only calls functions when it needs to, the
                  actions can be overwritten by calling more frequently than the
                  game script in question is. This however needs to be balanced and optimized.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It is possible to terminate running game scripts however this
                  can lead to unintentional consequences since a game script
                  often has more than one responsibility.

                Native Function Research: My research into native functions has
                contributed to the modding community, with some of my findings
                being utilized by projects like FiveM. It’s rewarding to see my
                work have a broader impact.

              <h3>Unity Game Engine Projects - 2D & 3D</h3>
              <br />
              <p>
                The main two projects are a ball game in 3D and a image viewer
                in 2D. Developed for Windows. A WebGL port of the ball game is
                half-working. The art image viewer in 2D has a working Windows
                version. It's however using a SQLite database in hopes of later
                porting to Android. WebGL doesn't allow SQLite. I have a
                database on wartem.se to connect to with MySQL but I have had
                issues with the Unity editor which is slowing down the progress
                of getting it to work.

                The main challenges here was getting the controls and camera
                working with the mouse and keyboard. The result is satisfyingly
                similar to the standard camera movement in third person view
                games. The mouse lets you rotate around the ball while the third
                person camera is set to follow the ball/car at a distance
                defined by user mouse scroll. Controls: WASD for movement, Space
                for shooting in the ball game and mouse for camera adjustments.

                From the GUI you can search type of art and by title, year,
                artist. To the left there's a scroll bar with the results as
                thumbnails. These can be clicked to get more information and a
                higher resolution version of the artwork in the big panel to the
                right. A high resolution image can then be downloaded.
