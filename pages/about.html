          <h1>Developing systems and finding solutions to problems is what I'm passionate about.</h1>

            Programming is a tool to achieve my goals. Being proficient in various development environments allows me to quickly
            implement my ideas. The current focus is to excel in Python, particularly Flask for web development, Pandas and
            Matplotlib for data analysis and visualization, web scraping techniques, and utilizing the OpenAI API for advanced
            applications.

          <h2>GTAV Scripts (Made in C++, ScriptHookV SDK)</h2>
          <p>Over 200,000 downloads in total on my official page: <a href="http://www.gta5-mods.com/users/R3QQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gta5-mods.com/users/R3QQ</a>.</p>
          <p>
            I'm especially proud of
            <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/r3qq/family-friendly-free-roaming/fffr-3-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
              >Family-Friendly Free-Roaming</a
            >. Its main feature is removing disturbing elements such as violence, thereby making the game safe for children. New fun
            features are also added. It's a huge project that I worked on, on and off, for 6-7 years in my spare time. It's one of
            my bigger projects and has over 20,000 lines of code. The focus here was on problem-solving within the context of
            ScriptHook V SDK.
          </p>
          <p>
            A lot of problem-solving was required to make this modification possible since there's no official SDK from the
            creators of the game, and the working of many native functions had to be guessed through trial and error. I've been
            active in the research led by Alexander Blade and published my findings in his native function database:

            install mods.
          </div>
          <h3>Examples of how I solved problems</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Since the game only calls functions when it needs to, the actions can be overwritten by calling more frequently than
              the game script in question is. This needs to be balanced and optimized.
            </li>
            <li>It is possible to terminate running game scripts; however, this can lead to unintended consequences.</li>
            <li>Trial and error and a lot of time.</li>
            <li>Adding findings to the research database and learning from others.</li>
            <li>Soft interrupts, such as redirecting a pedestrian animation rather than clearing all tasks.</li>

          <h2>Unity Game Engine Projects - 2D &amp; 3D</h2>
          <p>
            The main two projects are a ball game in 3D and an image viewer in 2D. Developed for Windows. A WebGL port of the ball
            game is half-working. The art image viewer in 2D has a working Windows version. It's using a SQLite database in hopes of
            later porting to Android.

          </div>
          <p>
            The main challenges were getting the controls and camera working with the mouse and keyboard. The result is similar to
            standard camera movement in third person view games. The mouse lets you rotate around the ball while the third person
            camera follows at a distance defined by user mouse scroll. Controls: WASD for movement, Space for shooting in the ball
            game, and mouse for camera adjustments.
          </p>
          <p class="note">
            You'll find a half-working version of the ball game at "Unity WebGL" in the nav.

            />
          </a>
          <p>
            OpenArtViewer uses
            <a href="https://www.nga.gov/open-access-images.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National Gallery of Art Open Data API</a>.
            The included SQLite database has stored info about the artworks including image links to the artworks on the NGA server.
          </p>
          <p>
            From the GUI you can search type of art and by title, year, artist. To the left there's a scroll bar with the results as
            thumbnails. These can be clicked to get more information and a higher resolution version of the artwork in the big panel
            to the right. A high resolution image can then be downloaded.
