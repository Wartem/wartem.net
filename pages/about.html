            <p>
              Developing systems and finding solutions to problems is what I'm
              passionate about.

                Programming is a tool for achieving goals. To be able to quickly
                implement thoughts and ideas, knowledge within development
                environments are important. On this page I want to share some of
                what I've done and maybe also what I'm working on right now.
                <br />

                This website is made in HTML, vanilla CSS (maybe some Bootstrap
                although I'm removing it to learn vanilla CSS), and vanilla
                Javascript (some jQuery too).
                <br />
                <br />
                Focus right now is learning Python and become as good as
                possible.

                I'm especially proud of Family-Friendly Free-Roaming. Its main
                feature is removing disturbing elements such as violence,
                thereby making the game safe for children. New fun features are
                also added. It's a huge project that I worked with, on and off
                for 5-6 years in my spare time.

                A lot of problem solving was required to make this modification
                possible since there's no official SDK from the creators of the
                game and the working of many native functions had to be guessed
                with trial and error. I've been active in the research lead by
                Alexander Blade and published my findings in his native
                database.

              <br />
              <p>
                The main two projects are a ball game in 3D and a image viewer
                in 2D. Developed for Windows. A WebGL port of the ball game is
                half-working. The art image viewer in 2D has a working Windows
                version. It's however using a SQLite database in hopes of later
                porting to Android. WebGL doesn't allow SQLite. I have a
                database on wartem.se to connect to with MySQL but I have had
                issues with the Unity editor which is slowing down the progress
                of getting it to work.

                The main challenges here was getting the controls and camera
                working with the mouse and keyboard. The result is satisfyingly
                similar to the standard camera movement in third person view
                games. The mouse lets you rotate around the ball while the third
                person camera is set to follow the ball/car at a distance
                defined by user mouse scroll. Controls: WASD for movement, Space
                for shooting in the ball game and mouse for camera adjustments.

                From the GUI you can search type of art and by title, year,
                artist. To the left there's a scroll bar with the results as
                thumbnails. These can be clicked to get more information and a
                higher resolution version of the artwork in the big panel to the
                right. A high resolution image can then be downloaded.
