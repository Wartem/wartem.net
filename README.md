# Personal Website

## Project Overview

Welcome to the repository for **Wartem.net**, my personal website! This site serves as a digital portfolio and a platform to share some of projects, and experiences.
This project is an early personal website that I developed as a learning experience a few years ago. While it showcases my initial foray into web development, I want to acknowledge that the code may not adhere to the best practices.

## Future Improvements

I might revisit this project, adding more content, refactor it and using best practices. Alternatively I'll start from scratch.

## New projects
I plan to put new projects on my project hub: http://wartem.xyz
