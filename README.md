## Project Overview

Welcome to the repository for **Wartem.net**, my personal website! This site serves as a digital portfolio and a platform to share some of projects, and experiences.
This project is an early personal website that I developed as a learning experience a few years ago. While it showcases my initial foray into web development, I want to acknowledge that the code may not adhere to the best practices.

## About This Project

This project was created entirely by me without the assistance of AI tools. While I acknowledge that some parts of the code could benefit from refactoring, I chose to present the work in its original state to accurately showcase my personal coding style and problem-solving approach.

I am aware that leveraging AI tools for refactoring could improve the overall code quality. However, I wanted to emphasize that the logic, structure, and implementation are entirely my own, reflecting my current skill level and understanding.

I also believe that there is a careful balance required when using AI tools and generators in software development. While these tools can greatly enhance productivity and help enforce best practices, it's essential to ensure that the final product still represents the developerâ€™s own skills and creativity. Over-reliance on AI can dilute the personal touch and problem-solving insights that are critical to writing effective and maintainable code.

In future iterations, I plan to explore the use of AI-assisted refactoring to further enhance the codebase. However, for this submission, I prioritized originality, transparency, and the demonstration of my individual capabilities.


## New projects
I plan to put new projects on my project hub: http://wartem.xyz
