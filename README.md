## Project Overview

Welcome to the repository for **Wartem.net**, my personal website. This site serves as a digital portfolio and a platform to share selected projects and experiences.

This project began as an early personal website that I developed several years ago as a learning exercise. It reflects my initial steps into web development, and some aspects naturally diverge from modern best practices.

## About This Project

The original version of this project was developed entirely by me, but parts of the current write-up, documentation, and ongoing improvements have been refined with assistance from AI tools. While the underlying code still reflects my own logic, structure, and problem-solving approach, I now use AI selectively to support tasks such as rewriting documentation, reviewing patterns, or identifying areas for potential refactoring.

I consider AI a valuable aid in software development, particularly for enhancing clarity, enforcing best practices, and accelerating routine tasks. At the same time, I aim to maintain a balance: the core design decisions and implementation choices remain my own, ensuring that the project continues to represent my actual skills and thought process rather than becoming overly shaped by automated suggestions.

In future iterations, I plan to use AI-assisted refactoring more extensively to improve maintainability and modernize the codebase. For now, the repository combines my original work with transparent, incremental enhancements supported by AI, preserving both authenticity and continuous improvement.
